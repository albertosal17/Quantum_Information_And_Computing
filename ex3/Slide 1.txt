Fortran Advantages:

- Compiled → Faster: 
  Fortran is compiled to machine code, making it very fast for executing 
  complex numerical computations.
- Powerful Numerical Computing Capacity: Fortran is known for its   
  excellent performance and libraries optimized for scientific and numerical 
  tasks.
- Numerical Precision: Fortran provides robust support for numerical precision, which is essential for applications in scientific    
  computing that require high accuracy over long calculations.

Disadvantages of Fortran:
    Ease of Use and Syntax:
         Fortran’s syntax can be more complex and less intuitive, making rapid prototyping and development slower.




Python Pros:
- Powerful Libraries for Data Analysis and Visualization:  
  Python’s ecosystem includes tools such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, 
  and Seaborn, making it a popular choice for data handling and 
  visualization.
- General Ease of Use: Python’s simple syntax makes it beginner-
  friendly and great for rapid development.
- Rich Environment for Machine Learning and AI: Python is the go-to language for machine learning and artificial intelligence, thanks to libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. This is important if you plan to extend your numerical results to predictive models or data-driven insights
- Parallel Processing and Scalability: Python has frameworks like Dask and multiprocessing for parallel processing, which, when combined with Fortran's computational power, can result in highly efficient workflows for big data or simulations.

Disadvantages of Python:

    Performance Limitations:
        Python is an interpreted language, which makes it slower for intensive computational tasks.
